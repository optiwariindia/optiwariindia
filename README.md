# Om Prakash Tiwari

Senior Backend Engineer specializing in Distributed Systems, Microservices, and Scalable Infrastructure.

I design and build fault-tolerant, high-performance backend systems using modern microservices and message-driven architecture.

## Core Expertise

• Distributed Systems Architecture  
• Microservices Design and Implementation  
• Message-driven Systems (NATS, queues, async processing)  
• Backend Scalability and Fault Tolerance  
• Containerized Infrastructure using Docker  
• SQL and NoSQL Database Design  

---

## Current Focus

Currently building a production-grade Distributed Notification System with:

• Microservices architecture  
• NATS message broker for asynchronous communication  
• Priority-based message queues (High / Medium / Low)  
• Retry logic and dead-letter queue handling  
• Docker-based containerized deployment  
• PostgreSQL for transactional data  
• MongoDB for scalable message storage  
• Redis for caching and performance optimization  

This system is designed using real-world distributed systems patterns used in high-scale SaaS platforms.
